### üõ†Ô∏è About this version

- All notebooks are written in **English**.
- Each topic is covered in a separate **`.ipynb` notebook**, organized and numbered for clarity.
- The structure differs from the original course repository to better suit **interactive learning** and **note-taking**.
- Markdown cells include **detailed explanations**, not present in the original code files.
- Folder structure was reorganized under `notebooks/` and `data/` to keep things clean and modular.

Feel free to follow along using these notebooks, even if you're not watching the original course ‚Äî each one is self-contained.
